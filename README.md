# Reading List

This is a React app that creates a reading list. This is also my first attempt to deploy a React app on Github Pages. The code for the app is a copy of an app that was based on a React tutorial on YouTube. Here is the repository for the original app:

https://github.com/songwright/netninja-react-context-hooks-tutorial

The app is deployed on GitHub pages:
https://songwright.github.io/readinglist/

I used the instructions on this page for this deployment:
